    On localhost, the deployer account is the one that comes with Hardhat, which is already funded.

    When deploying to live networks (e.g `yarn deploy --network sepolia`), the deployer account
    should have sufficient balance to pay for the gas fees for contract creation.

    You can generate a random account with `yarn generate` or `yarn account:import` to import your
    existing PK which will fill DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED in the .env file (then used on hardhat.config.ts)
    You can run the `yarn account` command to check your balance in every network.
